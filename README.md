# Deep-Neural-Network-Application-
The notebook develops and tests a deep neural network to solve a classification problem using a dataset. It includes steps for data preparation, model implementation, training, and evaluation.
.
# Neural Network Architecture

- Input Layer: Matches the number of features in the dataset.
- Hidden Layers: Multiple dense (fully connected) layers with activation functions (like ReLU) for non-linearity.
- Output Layer: Configured with the number of classes and a softmax activation for classification.
# Compiling the Model
 The model is compiled with:
- Loss Function: Categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification.
- Optimizer: Adam optimizer for efficient gradient-based optimization.
- Metrics: Accuracy, to evaluate performance during training and testing.
# Training the Model
- The dataset is split into training and validation sets.
- The model is trained using the training data over several epochs.
Metrics like accuracy and loss are monitored on both training and validation sets.
# Evaluating the Model
- The trained model is tested on a separate test dataset.

# Visualization of Results
- Training and validation loss/accuracy curves are plotted to understand the model's performance and detect underfitting or overfitting.
